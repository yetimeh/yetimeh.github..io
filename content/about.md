Hey there! üëãüèª

I'm Yeti, a self-taught developer based on Sri Lanka (‚úø‚ó°‚Äø‚ó°)

I write code for fun, I try. I'm a student so I'm learning with time. I write code in Python, C#, C++, Flutter. I'm currently learning __game development with Unreal Engine 5__. 

In my free time I usually write code, watch random TV series and write more code. You can see a list of the projects I've worked on in the [projects](/projects) section.

I also do freelancing work in my free time. I try to learn as much as I can however I can. 

I'm also a huge music person. My most frequent genres are rock, metal, rap, hip hop, pop sometimes, trap metal, screamy music.
